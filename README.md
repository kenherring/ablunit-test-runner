# ABLUnit Test Runner üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/github/kenherring/ablunit-test-runner/main?logo=circleci)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/kenherring/ablunit-test-runner/tree/main) [![Maintainability Rating](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=kenherring_ablunit-test-runner&metric=sqale_rating)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=kenherring_ablunit-test-runner) [![Coverage](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=kenherring_ablunit-test-runner&metric=coverage)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=kenherring_ablunit-test-runner)

The [ABLUnit Test Runner](https://github.com/kenherring/ablunit-test-runner/) VSCode extension integrates [ABLUnit tests](https://docs.progress.com/bundle/openedge-developer-studio-help-122/page/Learn-About-ABLUnit-Test-Framework.html) into the VSCode test explorer.

This is my first VSCode extension, and my first TypeScript project. I'm sure there are many ways to improve the code, and I welcome any feedback.  I'm also open to collaboration for anyone who might wish to contribute.

Quality code is my passion.  Unit testing is an important component of ensuring code remains functional when future changes are made.  I hope this extension helps others to embrace [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and improve their code.

## üå¥ Features

* Execute ABLUnit tests from the VSCode **Test Explorer View**
* Display test results in the VSCode **Test Results View**
* Color coded line coverage highlighting in the editor

## üìù Supported OpenEdge Versions

This project was developed using the [Progress OpenEdge Developers Kit: Classroom Edition](https://www.progress.com/openedge/classroom-edition).  It was primarily tested with 12.2.12, but the unit tests are run for 12.7.0 during the CI builds too.

## ‚õ∫ Configuration

The configuration is broken into two sections.

1.  The first section shows configuration options that users are most likely to change.
2.  Additional configuration options available that are not likely to be change by most users.

### Configuration - Sample Config

This config searches the `test/` directory for test files, named `*Test.cls` or `*Test.p`.  It also passes a database connection to `_progres` via the `-pf` parameter.

**`.vscode/settings.json`**:

```json
{
  "ablunit.files.include": [
    "test/**/*Test.{cls,p}"
  ],
  "ablunit.params": "-pf path/to/dbconnections.pf"
}
```

### Configuration - VSCode Configuration (`.vscode/settings.json`, et al.)

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ablunit.discoverFilesOnActivate` | `true` | Search all workspace files for test cases.  It may be beneficial to disable this for large workspaces, in which case the extension will find tests as files are accessed. |
| `ablunit.files.include` | `[ "**/*.{cls,p}" ]` | Glob pattern array to include test files |
| `ablunit.files.exclude` | `[ "**/.builder/**" ]` | Glob pattern array to exclude test files |
| `ablunit.importOpenedgeProjectJson` | `true` | Import configuration settings from \`openedge-project.json\` when possible |
| `ablunit.notificationsEnabled` | `true` | Enable/disable notifications |
| `ablunit.test.classlabel` | `classname` | The label to display for test classes. Example for class with path \`com/example/myClass.cls\`\:<br><br>* class-type-name example\: \`com.example.myClass\`<br>* filename example\: \`myClass.cls\` |

### Configuration - Test Run Configuration (`.vscode/ablunit-test-profile.json`)

Running tests will work for most users without any configuration.  However, there are some advanced options available which can be configured via `.vscode/ablunit-test-profile.json`.
