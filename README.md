[![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/github/kenherring/ablunit-test-provider/insiders?logo=circleci)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/kenherring/ablunit-test-provider/tree/insiders) [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=kenherring_ablunit-test-provider&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=kenherring_ablunit-test-provider)

The [ABLUnit Test Runner](https://github.com/kenherring/ablunit-test-provider/) VSCode extension integrates [ABLUnit tests](https://docs.progress.com/bundle/openedge-developer-studio-help-122/page/Learn-About-ABLUnit-Test-Framework.html) into the VSCode test explorer.

This branch, `insiders` exists to test and showcase this extensions usage of the [VSCode Test API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/123713) ahead of it's official release.

See the [`main`](https://github.com/kenherring/ablunit-test-provider?tab=readme-ov-file#ablunit-test-runner---) branch of this repository for the latest stable release.
