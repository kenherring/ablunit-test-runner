////# !!!!! This file and the configuration values are not required !!!!!
////# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
////#
////# Keys which are not provided in this file will use the defaults as referenced below.
////#
////#  * Blank values are the same as not providing the key.
////#  * Some keys can be disabled by settings to null, see key desription for details.
////#  * All paths are assumed as relative to the workspace, or absolute.
////#
////# The following substituion can be used in path values:
////#   * ${DLC} - The value of the DLC environment variable
////#   * ${tempDir} - See the "tempDir" key below
////#   * ${workspaceFolder} - The path of the folder opened in VS Code

{
	"configurations": [{

		////# The run profile the configuration object is related to.
		////# Valid values: "run", "coverage", "debug"
		"runProfile": "coverage",

		////# Path to directory where temporary files will be written.  This path will be
		////# added to the command line with the temporary directory (-T) option.
		////# Files generated by this extension and OpenEdge progress will be written here.
		////#
		////# NOTE: A null value will disable the -T option from the command execution but
		////#       may still use the default value for extension generated files.
		"tempDir": "${workspaceFolder}",

		////# When true read 'openedge-project.json' to determine proper configuration
		////# including DLC, propath, and database connections.

		////# Configuration object related to the command line run to execute tests.
		"command": {

			////# Path to the executable used launch the test run.
			"executable": "_progres",

			////# Path to the "progressIni" file which can define a propath, etc.  It will be
			////# passed to the test run process with the following parameters:
			////#    '-basekey INI -ininame ${progressIni}'
			////#
			////# Notes:
			////#   * When the value provided resolves to an existing file it will be copied
			////#     to the "tempDir" before test execution.
			////#   * If no value is provided or the file does not exist the extension will
			////#     attempt to create a default progress.ini file in the "tempDir".
			////#   * A blank value will remove the related args from the command line.
			"progressIni": "progress.ini",

			////# Include batch mode (-b) argument
			"batch": true,

			////# These parameters will be passed to the command line.  Most commonly
			////# this would be used to provide database connection parameters.

			////#    "-pf",

			////# ],
			"additionalArgs": [
				"-pf",

		////# The "config" key contains values that will be added to 'ablunit.json'.
		////# See the OpenEdge documentation for more information about these values.

		////# By default this extension enable the PROFILER when running tests.  The output
		////# is parsed to calculate and render code coverage.  The keys in this section can be
		////# modified to further change the behavior of the PROFILER during test execution.
		////#
		////# These options are added to a 'profiler.options' file and passed as command line args:
		////#   `-profile ${tempDir}/profiler.options`
		////#
		////# NOTES:
		////#   * When the "enabled" flag is false the process will not have the profiler enabled
		////#     on startup but the `-profile` option is passed to the command., args will not be passed to
		////#     the command line, and the "profiler.options" file will not be created.
		////#   * When the "profiler" key is set to null the 'profile.options' file will not
		////#     be created and the `-profile` option will not be passed to the command line.
