////#  * Some keys can be disabled by settings to null, see key desription for details.
////#  * All paths are assumed as relative to the workspace, or absolute.
////#
////# The following substituion can be used in path values:
////#   * ${DLC} - The value of the DLC environment variable
////#   * ${tempDir} - See the "tempDir" key below
////#   * ${workspaceFolder} - The path of the folder opened in VS Code

		////# added to the command line with the temporary directory (-T) option.
		////# Files generated by this extension and OpenEdge progress will be written here.

		////# NOTE: A null value will disable the -T option from the command execution but

			////#
			////# Notes:
			////#   * When the value provided resolves to an existing file it will be copied
			////#     to the "tempDir" before test execution.
			////#   * If no value is provided or the file does not exist the extension will
			////#     attempt to create a default progress.ini file in the "tempDir".
			////#   * A blank value will remove the related args from the command line.
			"progressIni": "progress.ini",
