# [1.1.0](https://github.com/kenherring/ablunit-test-runner/releases/tag/1.1.0) - 2025-02-16

## Release Notes

This release significantly improves the coverage reporting and leverages the native VSCode API to provide coverage attribution by test case.

* Suggest enabling `testing.coverageToolbarEnabled` in your VSCode settings to get the full effect of the improved coverage reporting.
* This release is more heavily dependent on rcode parsing for source mapping.
* If for whatever reason you do not have rcode available for your tests you can enable the `coverage` option in `.vscode/ablunit-test-profile.json` to parse from the profiler output.
* Backup xref parsing still exists but will likely be deprecated.

## Change Summary

* Line execution counts, improved ranges, and fix individual test coverage (#246)
* Add OpenEdge 12.8.6 test target (#247)
* Ungroup overloaded methods for coverage reporting (#245)
* Target multiple versions of node when running tests (#243)
* Add test cases to validate source map parsing source (#239)
* Add profiler options `perTest` and `ignoreExternalCoverage` for improved parsing performance (#238)
* Replace snippets with CompletionItemProvider for better granularity (#237)
* Profile parsing performance improvement for multiple data files (#235)
* improve messages for compile errors (#233)
* Test coverage attribution (#228)
* Refactor file access functions (#229)
* [chore] npm update (#226)
* Call stack parsing: support multiple errors per test case and negative line numbers for implicit constructors (#223)

## Known Bugs

* Destructors appear as overloaded constructors in the coverage reporting.
* Fallback to xref parsing gives disjoint source mapping. This will probably be deprecated.
